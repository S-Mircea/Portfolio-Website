    readmeContent: `# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment Web App

## Overview

This project is a modern, full-stack web application for personalized cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment. It combines machine learning, environmental data, and a local Llama language model (via Ollama) to provide users with both a risk score and actionable, environment-aware health advice.

Developed as a final-year Computer Science project, the app demonstrates the integration of data science, web development, and AI-powered user interaction.

---

## Features

- **CVD Risk Prediction:**  
  Users enter their health and lifestyle data, and the app predicts their 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease using a trained machine learning model.

- **Environmental Risk Factors:**  
  The app incorporates local environmental data (e.g., air pollution, green space) based on the user's London borough.

- **Personalized Llama AI Advice:**  
  After risk assessment, the app uses a local Llama model (via Ollama) to generate 3 practical, personalized tips for improving cardiovascular health, tailored to both the user's profile and their environment.

- **Modern Web Interface:**  
  Clean, responsive UI with clear risk visualization, key risk factors, and advice cards.

    readmeContent: `# EuroConnect Telecommunications Network

## Project Overview

This is a university project for **COMP 1815 JVM Programming Languages** that implements a telecommunications network optimization system for connecting European capitals. The project uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) to determine the most cost-effective way to lay telecommunications cables between European cities.

## What it does

The EuroConnect system:
- Reads distance data between European capitals from a CSV file
- Constructs a weighted graph where cities are vertices and distances are edge weights
- Applies Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm to find the optimal cable layout
- Calculates the total minimum cable length required to connect all cities
- Displays the connections that should be made and their individual distances

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components

- **Main.kt**: Entry point that handles user input and orchestrates the program flow
- **Graph.kt**: Graph data structure with methods to load data from CSV and calculate MST
- **KruskalAlgorithm.kt**: Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm using Union-Find data structure
- **input.csv**: Sample data file containing distances between European capitals

### Algorithm Details

The project implements Kruskal's algorithm with:
- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)**: Efficiently detects cycles during MST construction
- **Path Compression**: Optimizes find operations in the Union-Find structure  
- **Union by Rank**: Balances the union operations for better performance

## Educational Purpose

This project demonstrates:
- Graph theory concepts and minimum spanning trees
- Kruskal's algorithm implementation
- Union-Find data structure with optimizations
- File I/O operations in Kotlin
- Object-oriented programming principles in Kotlin

## University Information

- **Course**: COMP 1815 JVM Programming Languages
- **Institution**: University of Greenwich
- **Language**: Kotlin (JVM)`

A beautiful, mobile-friendly website for Hope Coffee - a cozy local coffee shop in Stanford-Le-Hope, UK.

## What is this project?

This is a website I built for a local coffee business. It's a simple, clean website that works great on phones, tablets, and computers. The website has three main pages:

- **Home Page** - Welcome visitors and show what makes Hope Coffee special
- **Menu Page** - Display all the delicious coffee drinks, pastries, and prices
- **About Page** - Tell the story of Hope Coffee and meet the team

## What technologies did I use?

- **Next.js 15** - A modern web framework that makes websites fast and easy to build
- **TypeScript** - Helps catch errors and makes code more reliable
- **Tailwind CSS** - Makes styling and responsive design much easier
- **React** - The foundation for building interactive user interfaces

## Features

‚úÖ **Mobile-friendly** - Looks great on all devices
‚úÖ **Fast loading** - Optimized images and modern code
‚úÖ **Easy to navigate** - Simple, clean design
‚úÖ **Professional look** - Perfect for a local business
‚úÖ **SEO optimized** - Helps people find the coffee shop online

## Deployment

This website can be easily deployed to:
- **Vercel** (recommended for Next.js)
- **Netlify**
- **GitHub Pages**

Just connect your GitHub repository to any of these platforms!
